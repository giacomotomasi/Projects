# BrewDay App!


University Project consisting in a mobile application developed for Android devices through Android Studio.

The app is meant to help beer brewers. The users are able to add, modify and remove ingredients and recipes from a local database and get recommendations based on ingredients availability and preferences. The recommendation algorithm takes into account the available ingredients of the user and the "history" of its choices and generates a score for each beer recipe. The recipe with the higher score is the one recommended. The app was entirely developed in Java and the local DataBase was managed through SQLiteOpenHelper. The graphical interface has been developed with the dedicated section of Android Studio, which provided XML files.
